### Social_network_analysis_project

### README
### Overview

This repository contains a Colab file (`Web_mining_project.ipynb`) that demonstrates various data preprocessing and analysis techniques on a Twitter dataset using Python. The notebook showcases how to load the dataset directly from GitHub, preprocess text data using NLTK and SpaCy, perform network analysis using NetworkX, visualize interaction networks, and apply graph frameworks like NetworkX,GraphX,igraph,Gephi and compare performance between the igraph and NetworkX framworks on this particular dataset.
